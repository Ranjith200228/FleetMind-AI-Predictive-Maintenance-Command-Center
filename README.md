##   Summary

This project simulates a **real-world predictive maintenance platform** used in autonomous fleets and industrial IoT systems.

The system predicts **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of equipment using machine learning and deep learning models, enabling proactive maintenance decisions that reduce downtime and operational cost.

This mirrors production ML pipelines used at companies like Tesla, Amazon Robotics, and industrial AI platforms.

The system is designed for fleet operators to shift from reactive repairs to predictive reliability.
