##  Live Demo

 Deploying on AWS App Runner…  
(Live URL will appear here after activation)

---

##  Executive Summary

This project is a production-style predictive maintenance system that forecasts engine failure risk and transforms raw telemetry into actionable maintenance decisions.

It demonstrates the full lifecycle of modern ML engineering:

data ingestion → feature engineering → model training → deployment → interactive decision dashboard → cloud architecture

The system is designed for fleet operators to shift from reactive repairs to predictive reliability.
